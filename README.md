# About this Project
This project exists solely for practicing git and github. 
For extra terminal practice, all folders and files were made using the Terminal CLI (Command Line Interface).
This README file was made using Terminal commands, 
but this README content was typed in the VSCode editor.
# Some more info about this project
The local git repo has already been pushed successfully to GitHub.
But now the local repo is being changed with updates to this README file.
So, the changes will have to be pushed up to GitHub again.
