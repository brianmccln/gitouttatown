# Vision and Mission: What's the Difference?

Similar to a mission statement, a vision statement provides a concrete way for stakeholders, 
especially employees, to understand the meaning and purpose of your business. However, unlike 
a mission statement – which describes the who, what and why of your business – a vision statement 
describes the desired long-term results of your company's efforts. For example, an early 
Microsoft vision statement was "a computer on every desk and in every home."\

Before determining your vision statement, you need to understand what it is not. It should not 
be confused with a mission statement. Those statements are based in the present and designed to 
convey why the business exists to both members of the company and the external community.\

Vision statements, on the other hand, are future-based and meant to inspire and give direction 
to employees of the company rather than customers.\
